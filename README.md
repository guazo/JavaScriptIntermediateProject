# Task Management Website

## Overview

This is a simple task management website that allows you to create, organize, and track tasks. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and incorporates various programming concepts, including classes, switch statements, and try-catch-finally statements.

## How to Use

1. **Adding Tasks**: To add a new task, fill out the "Task Title," "Description," and select the task's status from the dropdown menu ("To Do," "In Progress," or "Done"). Click the "Add Task" button, and your task will be added to the list.

2. **Changing Task Status**: You can change the status of a task by clicking the "Start" button to move it to "In Progress" or the "Finish" button to mark it as "Done."

3. **Deleting Tasks**: To remove a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task you want to delete.

4. **Task List Display**: The tasks are displayed in a list, and each task's status is color-coded: "To Do" tasks are gray, "In Progress" tasks are green, and "Done" tasks are blue.

5. **Progress Bars**: There are progress bars at the top of the page that visually represent the distribution of tasks in each status category. The percentage of tasks in each category is displayed alongside the bars.

## Programming Concepts

### Classes

- The website uses JavaScript classes to define tasks. Each task is represented as an instance of the `Task` class, which includes properties such as title, description, and status.

### Switch Statements

- Switch statements are employed to handle different task statuses. When adding or displaying tasks, a switch statement is used to determine the appropriate action or styling based on the task's status.

### Try-Catch-Finally Statements

- Try-catch-finally statements are used to handle potential errors when adding or deleting tasks. If there are errors, such as an invalid task status or index, the code within the try block gracefully handles these issues, preventing the website from breaking.

## Conclusion

This task management website demonstrates the use of classes, switch statements, and try-catch-finally statements to create a functional and error-resistant application for managing tasks. It provides an intuitive user interface for managing tasks efficiently.
